"""Locate a building-block directory by its (pre-reorg) identity name under the group-by-technique
_sources layout.

The reorg renamed the per-technique BB dirs to roles (techniqueProfile/<tech>/{tapp,detail,profile,
profile-ada}), so a lookup by the old identity name (empaTAPP, detailLAICPMS, adaEMPA, empaProfile…)
no longer matches a directory name. This resolver maps those names to their new location:

  - identity-named BBs (adaProduct, tappDefinition, registry catalogs, BaseSchema helpers): exact search
  - <x>TAPP        -> techniqueProfile/<tech>/tapp
  - detail<X>      -> techniqueProfile/<tech>/detail   (detailXCT -> .../detail-legacy)
  - ada<X> generic -> techniqueProfile/<tech>/profile-ada
  - <geochem name> -> techniqueProfile/<tech>/profile   (empaProfile, LA-ICPMS, Geochron, SEM-Imaging…)
